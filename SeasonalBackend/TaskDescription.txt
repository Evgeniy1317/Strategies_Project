I have these individual scripts each produces a handful of strategies. I have documented them in this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Eo751wq0jrq8pEfmtaijh3O5nuKCMSUV-eSknnoLRI8/edit?usp=sharing

My goal is to turn these python scripts into a "backend service" that can issue alerts to these strategies.

We can assume there will be updated data by 18:00 EST (server is EST) and the data will be in Data/ folder like all the scripts show. Some strategies operate on the daily data. Some resample the data to monthly.

For example, one of the strategies buys SLVRaw.txt and holds for all of January so after we receive the last bar in December I want an api response like "Strategy 7 should sell {symbol2} and buy SLV". We can discuss how to detect the "last bar in December". It won't be always Dec 31 because of weekends or holiday.

I also want to return each strategy's CAGR, Total Return which the scripts should already calculate!

Please let me know what questions you have and if you can help! I am expecting questions so ask any and all, no problem.
